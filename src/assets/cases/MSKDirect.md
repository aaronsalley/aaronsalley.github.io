# üöÄ Case Study: Bringing MSK Direct‚Äôs Digital Services to Market

_By a Principal Product Manager at MSK_

https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=MSK+Direct+App+UX+Mockup

## üß≠ Introduction: Reimagining Access to Cancer Expertise

When we embarked on the journey to digitize MSK Direct, we weren‚Äôt just launching a product‚Äîwe were reshaping how people access world-class cancer care. MSK Direct, Memorial Sloan Kettering‚Äôs employer-based cancer benefit program, had already proven its value through expert medical opinions and care navigation. But the digital experience needed to catch up with the promise.

Our mission was clear: deliver a seamless, scalable, and deeply human digital experience that could meet patients where they are‚Äîemotionally, geographically, and technologically.

---

## üìà The Why: Strategic Imperatives and Market Forces

In 2022, MSK Direct faced a pivotal moment. Competition in the employer oncology space was intensifying, and our access to commercially insured patients‚Äîcritical to MSK‚Äôs financial sustainability‚Äîwas under threat. The digital roadmap outlined three strategic imperatives:

1. **Scale virtual consultations** through automation and streamlined workflows.
2. **Expand services** to include proactive outreach, screening navigation, and survivorship support.
3. **Deliver a frictionless digital experience** to improve utilization and satisfaction [1](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/Shared%20Documents/Archive/Product%20Management%20and%20Business%20Delivery/Product%20Management%20Lifecycle/MSKCC_Forrester%20Final%20deliverables/MSKCC_Forrester%20Digits_PMM.pdf?web=1).

These goals were tied to measurable outcomes: reducing physician time per consult to under 20 minutes, increasing virtual consult volume, and improving Net Promoter Scores (NPS) across partners [2](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEMAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAAFtJiMPAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

## üß± Phase 1: Building the Foundation

### Aligning Strategy and Stakeholders

We began by aligning across product, operations, marketing, and informatics. The 2022 digital investment plan had laid the groundwork [1](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/Shared%20Documents/Archive/Product%20Management%20and%20Business%20Delivery/Product%20Management%20Lifecycle/MSKCC_Forrester%20Final%20deliverables/MSKCC_Forrester%20Digits_PMM.pdf?web=1), but we needed to translate that into a cohesive product strategy. This meant reconciling disparate systems‚ÄîSalesforce, MMS, MyMSK, and vendor platforms like Abet and Adams.

In one early meeting, I shared:

> ‚ÄúSalesforce can manage communications, but the incoming data needs to live elsewhere. We need to keep these data sets siloed to stay compliant‚Äù [3](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwCBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAALZ7BxqAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMjcHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

This became a guiding principle as we explored in-house outreach capabilities and data governance.

---

## üé® Phase 2: Designing for Empathy and Scale

### Personas and Product Decisions

We focused on three core user groups:

- **Patients and caregivers** navigating a diagnosis
- **Clinicians** providing expert opinions
- **Employer partners** seeking transparency and outcomes

The MSK Direct app was redesigned with these personas in mind. We introduced:

- Digital self-service for virtual consults and appointments
- Psychosocial support workflows
- UX nudges to guide users through complex decisions
- A national cancer care recommender to personalize resources [4](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/pub-StrategyAndInnovation/SitePages/Quantifying-MSK's-Clinical-Excellence--Updated-Survival-Outcomes-Analysis-for-MSK-Direct.aspx?web=1)

---

## ü§ù Phase 2.5: Building the App with Jasper ‚Äî A Strategic Partnership

One of the most defining aspects of our digital transformation was our partnership with Jasper Health. From the outset, we knew we didn‚Äôt want to build everything from scratch. Jasper brought a mature, oncology-focused digital platform with capabilities in psychosocial support, symptom tracking, and care navigation. But this wasn‚Äôt a plug-and-play integration‚Äîit was a co-creation effort that tested our agility, alignment, and ambition.

### Why Jasper?

Jasper had already built a digital care companion platform with over 3 million covered lives and a growing footprint in employer benefits. Their platform offered:

- A modular architecture that could support white-labeling
- Built-in support for caregivers, planners, and symptom tracking
- A scalable backend for EMO (Expert Medical Opinion) workflows
- A team willing to co-develop and iterate with us in real time [5](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEMAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANLWGv0AAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem) [6](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/teams/MSKDQuarterlyReporting/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9471BDAE-2718-44E5-9199-0D6DDA250A79%7D&file=MSK%20Direct%20Q2%202022%20Quarterly%20Leadership%20Update.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

As one internal strategy deck put it:

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a ride on their application. How far can the things that Jasper has built take us, starting with MSK Direct?‚Äù [6](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/teams/MSKDQuarterlyReporting/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9471BDAE-2718-44E5-9199-0D6DDA250A79%7D&file=MSK%20Direct%20Q2%202022%20Quarterly%20Leadership%20Update.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

### Co-Development in Action

The partnership was formalized in a Statement of Work (SOW) that outlined shared responsibilities, revenue models, and go-to-market alignment [7](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEMAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANLWGw5AAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem). Jasper agreed to limit its employer-facing efforts to the MSK Direct v1 offering, while MSK took the lead on contracting and onboarding.

We worked side-by-side with Jasper‚Äôs product and engineering teams to:

- Design a white-labeled MSK Direct app experience
- Integrate EMO workflows, including consent, intake, and document sharing
- Build a tiered access model (Premium vs. Basic) based on employer contracts [3](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwCBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAALZ7BxqAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMjcHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
- Enable proactive outreach using claims analytics and self-reported data [8](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEJAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMgqHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

### Testing, Feedback, and Iteration

The development process was rigorous. We ran multiple rounds of end-to-end (E2E) and user acceptance testing (UAT), uncovering dozens of issues‚Äîfrom accessibility violations to confusing EMO navigation [9](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B72CAD5C3-AD18-4FAA-A208-7C49FEAA3119%7D&file=IPF%202022%20Initiaitive%20Planning%20%26%20Prioritization%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [10](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/teams/PIMSAgileTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8D949589-A7DB-481D-91F4-306D20AC1296%7D&file=Copy%20of%20Scorecard%20Template%20V1_Personalization%20Engine_Business_FINAL%20%284%29.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

As Abigail Baldwin-Medsker noted in a UAT review:

> ‚ÄúFrom the very start of the user journey, there are material shortcomings in the app experience, which do not pass muster along multiple dimensions‚Äîincluding MSK brand, quality, and accessibility standards‚Äù [9](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B72CAD5C3-AD18-4FAA-A208-7C49FEAA3119%7D&file=IPF%202022%20Initiaitive%20Planning%20%26%20Prioritization%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

We triaged issues into hotfixes and fast-follow releases. A shared defect tracker in Rally and Google Sheets helped us stay aligned across teams.

### Integration with MSK Systems

One of the most complex challenges was integrating the Jasper app with MSK‚Äôs internal systems‚ÄîEpic, Salesforce, and the Member Management System (MMS). We explored two models:

1. **Open Scheduling Model**: Jasper handles the front-end; Epic handles scheduling and record sharing.
2. **Fully Integrated Model**: Bi-directional data sharing between Jasper and Epic [11](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEMAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANLWGxDAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

Each had trade-offs in terms of user experience, operational complexity, and cost. Ultimately, we opted for a phased approach, prioritizing speed to market while planning for deeper integration post-launch.

---

## üì£ Phase 3: Proactive Outreach and the Pivot to In-House

Our proactive outreach program‚Äîdesigned to identify likely cancer-affected lives via claims data‚Äîwas underperforming and over budget. Vendor costs had ballooned from $7,500 to $20,000/month [11](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEMAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANLWGxDAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

We explored insourcing. In a meeting I co-led, we debated the feasibility of using Salesforce Marketing Cloud to manage outreach internally. The legal, technical, and operational implications were vast. But the potential to reduce costs and increase agility was compelling [3](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwCBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAALZ7BxqAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMjcHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

We developed a risk-benefit assessment, engaged InfoSec, and mapped out a phased transition plan. As I shared with the team:

> ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about cost savings‚Äîit‚Äôs about owning the relationship with our members and being able to adapt in real time.‚Äù

---

## üß™ Phase 4: Launch, Learn, and Iterate

By mid-2025, we were deep into UAT. We scheduled demos, trained care advisors, and addressed feedback from stakeholders like Lauren, who was preparing for maternity leave [8](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEJAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMgqHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem). We prioritized empathy in our rollout‚Äîensuring that every user felt supported, not just trained.

We also tackled data migration challenges from MMS to Salesforce, ensuring a clean launch across all user segments [8](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQzMjk4NjA3LTk1ZDgtNGVmNy05NTNhLTU1MDcyYzE2OWZjNgBGAAAAAACfdwAhCKXaT7lcAllUaQu9BwC6ZgehY%2fp1SK%2b92gHKmVnZAAAAAAEJAACBwe6U3RHeT6k5nflLgOkgAANPMgqHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

We also saw record attendance at our wellness webinars, with over 1,000 unique attendees [12](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BDACD42BA-E829-4735-BAFD-DE2C5376E586%7D&file=2022%20Digital%20Initiatives%20Investments%20%20%281%29.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), and strong interest in new services like screening navigation [12](https://mskcc.sharepoint.com/sites/team-DPS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BDACD42BA-E829-4735-BAFD-DE2C5376E586%7D&file=2022%20Digital%20Initiatives%20Investments%20%20%281%29.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

## üí° Reflections: Lessons from the Front Lines

1. **Empathy is a design principle.** From UAT to outreach, we centered the emotional journey of patients and caregivers.
2. **Data governance is product strategy.** Our decisions about where and how to store data shaped the entire architecture.
3. **Cross-functional trust is everything.** This project succeeded because product, ops, legal, and marketing worked as one team.
4. **Partnerships require shared ownership.** Jasper wasn‚Äôt just a vendor‚Äîthey were a co-builder. That made all the difference.
